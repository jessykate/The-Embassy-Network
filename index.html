								<h1>Live & Collaborate in Locations Around the World</h1>
								<h2>A Housing network for driven world changers</h2>
								<br>
								<p>The Embassy Network is a private club for a new generation. It is a
								place to call home for professionals and creatives who travel the far
								reaches of the globe and the mind; a place to share a stimulating
								environment built around dynamic interaction, creativity, and intention
								where members can travel and always be at home.</p>

								<p>As collaborative work spaces have changed the landscape of business,
								the Embassy Network pushes creativity to the next level - getting the
								right people in the room, outside of formality, to cultivate innovation
								like never before. Members have access to full-time and/or
								flexible-duration accommodations, and receive access to collaborative
								space, events, and a global community of like-minded individuals.</p> 
							</div>


							<!-- rows with columns -->
							<div class="row">
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>Co-Living</h2>
									<p>Each Embassy location will offer short and long term residential
									accommodations in a co-living, community setting. Long term residents
									live in the Embassy as their primary residence, provide an anchor to
									local culture, and are active participants in creating activities and
									events at their location.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>Flexible Duration</h2>
									<p>In addition to long term accommodations, each Embassy provides
									short term accommodations operated much like a B&B. Members reserve
									space at any location in the network, anywhere around the world, as
									needed to support their travel, work, and collaborations.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>Community Space</h2>
									<p>Every Embassy location includes a community space open to members
									and friends to gather and connect. These spaces differ per-location.
									From co-working space to restaurants, each community space is a key
									tie-in to local culture and a way to remain outward focused in
									ideation, problem-solving, and relationship-building.</p>

									<h2><em>Purpose-driven</em></h2>
								</div>
								<div class="span8">
									<p>The Embassy Network will be a coordinating body: connecting
									existing properties, coordinating membership, supporting new
									houses, and providing online resources.</p>

									<p>Each individual property, or <em>local embassy node</em>,
									provides a curated space for organic and impromptu
									interactions. Each node has independent day-to-day operations
									and a distinct culture, hosting its own microcosm of workshops,
									salons, dinners, and other events. Residents are chosen by
									other residents, and the balance of rooms set aside for short-
									and long-term accommodation decided together between residents
									and the Global Embassy Network.</p>

									<p>By leveraging co-location, the fresh perspectives that comes
									with travel, the organic interactions that happen in the home
									environment, and the power of food for building community, we
									feel that the investment that we and others make in ourselves
									can be vastly enhanced. Need a little time to focus and
									reflect? Don't worry, there's space to get away as well. </p>

									<p>The first Embassy nodes are targeted for San Francisco and
									DC: two urban centers with high concentrations of creative
									individuals, both resident and transient. We consider our
									"minimum viable product" to be at least two cities for testing
									the financial and membership model.</p>

									<p>The ideal Embassy location has 3 specific functions:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>long-term residential rooms and/or suites, 
										<li>shorter-term accommodations, 
										<li>a public, possibly commercial, community-oriented space. 
									</ol>

									<p>An archetypal design would have this community space on the
									ground floor, open to foot traffic, and supporting collaborations
									and human interactions, keeping a fresh flow of people and
									ideas through the space. Each location will decide the
									specific theme or purpose of this community space as a
									function of its environment, local needs and culture. It might
									be a co-working space, cafe, restaurant, bar, or something
									else. The second floor would house short-term accommodation
									rooms, as well as a large, industrial-grade, shared kitchen,
									common rooms, and library.  Finally, the third floor would
									contain the longer term full time residences. These might be
									small suites, large rooms, or a combination of both.

									<h1>Membership</h1>
									<h2><em>Surround yourself with excellence.</em></h2>
								</div>
								<div class="span8">

									<p> Passion and drive are cultivated by a supportive external
									environment, and every Embassy location is a safe haven for new
									ideas, hard work, reflection, and fun. Membership in the
									Embassy Network is exclusive-- we want only those willing to
									assert, with no apologies, their passion for innovation,
									experimentation, and changing the world for the better. If you
									see yourself in these words, then you are home. There is no
									right or wrong. Only a shared purpose and committment.</p>

									<p>Members may either be full-time residents at a specific
									location in the network, or use the flexible accommodations
									much like they would use a Bed and Breakfast: as a replacement
									for the anonymous hotels, mass-produced food, and cultural
									disconnect that so often comes with traveling for work.</p>

									<p>Membership levels will exist to suit different needs, and include
									primary-residence, blocks of per-nite accomodation, and
									organizational membership.</p>

									<h1>Financial</h1>
									<h2><em>A community-profit organization.</em></h2>
								</div>
								<div class="span8">
									<p>The Embassy Network is incorporated as a Benefit Corporation
									in the state of California. Our fundamental governing principle
									is to never profiteer off our community and our homes.
									Correspondingly, we have set out to design an organization that
									at its core is not-for-profit, but that may take investment if
									the community decides there is a valuable opportunity to scale.
									The founding board of directors have inserted a corporate bylaw
									stating that shareholders and directors agree not to take
									dividends from the corporation; that any future directors or
									shareholders must explicitly agree to this bylaw, and that
									changing this by law requires full consensus of all
									shareholders and directors. (thus any decision about taking
									investors would also require this consensus). This is an
									experiment is creating what we have been calling a
									"community-profit" organization.</p>

									<p>Any future profits, should they exist, will be re-invested
									into Embassy Network activities, real estate purchases, or
									community funding to support projects of our members. Beyond
									this guiding principle and initial set of stipulations, we
									intend to select and experiment with decision making, fee and
									financial structures to ensure sustainability, together with
									members of the community.</p>

									<p>The Embassy Network will partner with houses to evolve an
									operational and financial model. It will also offer services
									such as online booking and payment, house management software,
									insurance, permitting guidance, cultural, design and financial
									assistance getting new houses off the ground, and policy
									advisory/advocacy efforts. </p>

									<h2>Interested?</h2> 
									<p>Anyone passionate about the idea is welcome to drop a line and

									in major cities, passionate creatives, and membership guinea pigs.
